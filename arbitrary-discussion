I think LFS  - see http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/ - or even a filesystem are probably out of our reach until we 
tackle and solve some smaller challenges. If we wrote a device driver it would be good if we had interesting hardware
in the department to write the driver for? Or at least something we have in some quantity to be able to test/experient?
I think it would be pretty awesome to contribute something to the department that our peers use/is used.
