I think LFS  - see http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/ - or even a filesystem
are probably out of our reach until we tackle and solve some smaller
challenges. If we wrote a device driver it would be good if we had interesting
hardware in the department to write the driver for? Or at least something we
have in some quantity to be able to test/experiment? I think it would be pretty
awesome to contribute something to the department that our peers use/is used.

I spoke to Zhiyi yesterday and he said he would organise a meeting for some time
after exams - this pull is a reminder of that.

In terms of direction of the Linux Repo, I'm especially interested in small
or embedded devices and parallel processing (strictly as a hobby), and AI.
Perhaps we could write something along those lines?

Other ideas re something for the department could be devices that help save
power - smart lighting and heating, for example. Or a small monitor which
indicates which lab you should use (i.e collates streamed labs and labs-in-use)
although that uses power. Maybe we could do both and have a net result of zero?
