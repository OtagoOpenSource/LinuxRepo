LinuxRepo
=========

The initial repo for the Linux team

We could go in a few directions:
- Doing something interesting but not of much use to the community, e.g. implementing a filesystem.
- Trying to do something useful for the community, e.g. writing some drivers.
- Try to do something which is useful for the department, e.g. something for one of the research groups perhaps?

We don't need to start a project yet but it would be good to get some discussion going!
